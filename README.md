# A pokemon/pokedex application

Goal for this project is to create an application for viewing pokemon data, similar to serebii.net or pokemondb.net. 

Ultimate goal is to write my own SQL database for storing the data, which would be scraped from serebii and pokemondb. For now, I believe I will use project Veekun for the data until I can write my own SQL.
